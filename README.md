- This repository is a tensorflow implementation of our work for Depression Detection task proposed in our BIBM'23 paper:
[Enhancing Depression Detection from Narrative Interviews Using Language Models]

- In this work, we are also releasing the I-DAIC dataset for Depression Detection task in healthcare domain. The I-DAIC consist of three datasets:
1. DAIC WOZ data
2. Extended DAIC WOZ data
3. EATD data
   
- You can apply for the DAIC WOZ and Extended DAIC WOZ access on [DAIC WOZ HOME](https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/) The translated EATD corpus and original translated corpus is provided in folder [EATD Dataset](https://github.com/palak97/IDAIC/tree/master/eatd_data) in this repository.
